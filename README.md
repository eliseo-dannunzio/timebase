Technical Test for TimeBase

From: TimeBase Pty Limited
Full Stack Developer - Frontend test

There is only one thing lawyers like more than winning: beer.

Our clients want to know the best beer to drink while using TimeBase and we are here to
help.

We got in contact with the UK brewery BrewDog and they are very happy to help us solve
this real problem. They provided a complete API listing all their beers and recipes, the
documentation can be found on https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2.

Internal research found out the following about our customers:
* they use TimeBase during meals
* they like light coloured beers (EBC <10) in the morning and dark beers (EBC > 30) in the
evening
* they like to drink bitter beers when running tax reports (IBU > 50)
* they like to drink high alcohol beers (ABV > 6%) on the weekend and low alcohol beers
(ABV < 4%) during the week.

We need you to develop a single page web application to help our valuable customers pick
the best beer for their usage.

We expect you to spend a few hours on this project to create an MVP solution based on your
understanding of the requirements above. We will be assessing your UI/UX as well as your
code.
