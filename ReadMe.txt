Some caveats with regards to this task:

1) I had to write this assignment in AngularJS, which is what I do know... For me to learn React, and ramp it up to a level that would have been acceptable for me to confidently write this assignment out would have taken weeks. As I did know AngularJS, but hadn't used it for some time, I did have to research one minor thing regarding scope-based functions, for which I couldn't quite remember the syntax...

2) I gave myself 4 hours to do this work, and I was strapped for time over this past week due to my wife being in hospital, so looking after her... Couple that with looking after a three year-old makes for a bit of a challenge when it came to finding sufficient time. 4 hours was all I had available to me...

3) Unfortunately, I did not have the kind of power on this particular laptop (Running Windows XP, so no NPM, no Node.js, No grunt, etc...) so I've had to write all these files to my GitHub repository. I hope your technical staff reviewing this code take this into consideration...

4) I also would not have been able to have sent through a zip file with this information through GMail as they have set up a policy that prohibits the sending of ZIP files... So the GitHub repo was the best (and probably my only viable option)...

5) I was focusing on the functionality of the task, my main focus when working on an assignment like this is functionality first, format final... In this case, there was no request to make this look pretty. I focussed on the main rules, which basically focused on lightness/darkness of the beer, bitterness and alcoholic content... I also made sure that the food pairings were also present.

6) The images component was a little tricky, but I overcame it... I did however, spend about 5 minutes staring at the... (I'd like to call it a "bottle"?) container for the "End of History" beer... It's very... "unique"? A taxidermist's dream, dare I say... You'll see why...
